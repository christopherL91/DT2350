                            She was sophisticated, poised, and cultured.  In
                            retrospect, this should have made them suspicious.
                            A teacher like her should be presiding over a girl’s
                            school in London or New York, not seeking a position
                            in a small town in Georgia.  But at the time, they
                            were too delighted by her application to ask any
                            questions.

                            “It will be good for our daughter to learn some
                            culture,” the attorney’s wife told the pastor’s
                            wife.

                            “And our boy may find some table manners at last,”
                            the pastor’s wife responded with a smile.

                            School was called into session in the local church
                            shortly after the arrival of the teacher.  And soon,
                            the children were bringing glowing reports home.
                            “Teacher” was special.  Teacher taught them manners
                            and diction as well as reading, writing and
                            arithmetic.  All the children loved teacher.

                            The parents were delighted by the progress their
                            children were making at school.  Teacher had been a
                            real find.  A God-send, said the preacher’s wife.

                            But not everyone in town was so satisfied.  The
                            local ne-er-do well – called Smith – had more
                            sinister stories to tell.

                            “That woman ain’t natural,” he told the blacksmith,
                            waving a bottle of whisky for emphasis.    “I seen
                            her out in the woods after dark, dancing around a
                            campfire and chanting in a strange language.”

                            “Nonsense,” the blacksmith retorted, calmly
                            hammering a headed iron bar on his anvil.

                            “They say she’s got an altar in her room and it
                            ain’t an altar to the Almighty,” Smith insisted,
                            leaning forward and blowing his boozy breath into
                            the blacksmith’s face.

                            “You’re drunk,” said the blacksmith, lifting the hot
                            iron so it barred the man from coming any closer.
                            “Go home and sleep it off.”

                            Smith left the smithy, but he continued to talk wild
                            about the Teacher in the weeks that followed.
                            During those weeks, a change gradually came over the
                            school children.  The typical high-jinks and pranks
                            that all children played lessened.  Their laughter
                            died away.  And when they did misbehave, it was on a
                            much more ominous scale than before.  Items began to
                            disappear from houses and farms.  Expensive items
                            like jewelry, farm tools, and money.  When children
                            talked back to their parents, there was a hard-edge
                            to their voices, and they did not apologize for
                            their rudeness, even when punished.

                            “And my daughter lied to me the other day,” the
                            attorney’s wife said to the pastor’s wife in
                            distress.  “I saw her punch her younger brother and
                            steal an apple from him, and she denied it to my
                            face.  She practically called me a liar!”

                            “The games the children play back in the woods
                            frighten me,” the pastor’s wife confessed.  “They
                            chant in a strange language, and they move in such a
                            strange manner.  Almost like a ritual dance.”

                            “Could it be something they are learning at school?”
                            asked the attorney’s wife.

                            “Surely not!  Teacher is such a sweet, sophisticated
                            lady,” said the pastor’s wife.

                            But they exchanged uneasy glances.

                            Smith, on the other hand, was sure.  “That teacher
                            is turning the young’uns to the Devil, that’s what
                            she’s doing,” he proclaimed up and down the streets
                            of the town.

                            “Don’t be ridiculous,” the preacher told him when
                            they passed in front of the mercantile.

                            “I ain’t ridiculous.  You are blind,” Smith told
                            him.  “That teacher ought to be burned at the stake,
                            like they burned the witches in Salem.”

                            The pastor, pale with wrath, ordered Smith out of
                            his sight.  But the ne’er-do-well’s words rang in
                            his mind and would not be pushed away.  And the
                            children continued to behave oddly.  Almost like
                            they were possessed.  He would, the preacher decided
                            reluctantly, have to look into it someday soon.

                            That day came sooner than he thought.  The very next
                            Monday, his little boy came down with a cold, and
                            his mother kept him home from school.  When the
                            pastor returned from his duties for a late lunch,
                            his wife came running up to him as soon as he
                            entered the door.  She was pale with fright.

                            “I heard him chanting something over and over again
                            in his bedroom,” she gasped.  “So I crept to the
                            door to listen.  He was saying the Lord’s Prayer
                            backwards!”

                            The pastor gasped and clutched his Bible to his
                            chest, as goose bumps erupted over his body.  This
                            was positively satanic.  And there was nowhere the
                            boy could have learned such a thing in this town,
                            unless he learned it…at school.

                            At that moment, the attorney's wife came bursting in
                            the door behind him.

                            "Quick pastor, quick," she cried.  "Smith is running
                            through town with a torch, talking about burning
                            down the school. The children are still in class!"

                            The pastor raced out of the house with the two woman
                            at his heels.  They and the other townsfolk who
                            followed them were met by a huge cloud of smoke
                            coming from the direction of the church, where the
                            school children had their lessons.  The building was
                            already ablaze as frantic parents beat at the flames
                            with wet sacks, or threw buckets of water from the
                            pump into the inferno.  Smith could be heard
                            cackling unrepentantly from the far side of the
                            building, which was full of the screams of the
                            trapped students and their teacher.

                            The fire blazed with a supernatural kind of force,
                            and the pastor thought he heard the sound of the
                            Teacher laughing from within the building when it
                            became apparent that no one could be saved.

                            The church burnt for several hours, and when it was
                            finally extinguished, there was nothing left.
                            Mourning parents tried to find something of their
                            children to bury, and Smith wisely disappeared from
                            town, his mission against the works of Satan
                            completed.

                            The teacher's burnt body was buried deep in the
                            ground and covered with brick tomb.  The children’s
                            smaller bodies were interred beneath wooden crosses.
                            Of all the student’s in the school that fall, only
                            the pastor’s small son survived.

                            To this day, voices can be heard in the graveyard of
                            at Burnt Church, chanting unintelligible words, as
                            the school children and the teacher once chanted in
                            the woods outside town.  Sometimes apparitions are
                            seen, and dark walkers who roam the graveyard at
                            night.  And they say that a brick taken from the
                            grave of the evil teacher can set fire to objects on
                            which they are placed.
