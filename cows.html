                            Oksana lived in a small house on the edge of town
                            with her father, her stepmother and her stepsister.
                            Oksana's stepmother disliked Oksana, favoring her
                            true daughter, Olena. <br> Soon after her father's
                            remarriage, Oksana found that all the housework fell
                            to her while Olena idled her days away. Oksana's
                            father was a timid man, and could not bring himself
                            to defy his wife. So Oksana wore Olena's cast off
                            clothes, and her hands grew red and chapped from
                            scrubbing in the cold, while Olena attended parties,
                            growing lazy and spoiled. <br> One year, when the winter
                            snows were particularly fierce, Oksana's family ran
                            out of money. Oksana's stepmother began nagging her
                            father to send Oksana away, because they could not
                            afford to keep two girls. Reluctantly, Oksana's
                            father agreed. He took Oksana to a cottage deep in
                            the woods and left her there. <br> Oksana was very
                            frightened. The woods were said to be filled with
                            demons and monsters. But Oksana was also practical.
                            She entered the cottage with her small bundle and
                            found a fireplace, a lopsided table and a rusty old
                            pot. Oksana put away the loaf of bread, the knife
                            and the slab of cheese her father had given her. She
                            folded the blanket and laid it near the fireplace.
                            Then she collected wood and built a fire. <br> Oksana
                            knew the bread and cheese would not last her all
                            winter. So she made a snare using the thin, flexible
                            branches of the trees and caught a snow rabbit to
                            eat. She also dug under the deep snow, and found
                            some roots and berries for food. <br> By dark, Oksana
                            had melted water for drinking, and used the rest to
                            make a stew. So Oksana ate well. Then she lay down
                            near the fire for the night, listening to the wind
                            howl and pretending to herself that she was not
                            frightened of the woods. <br> It was midnight when the
                            knock came. <br> Knock, knock, knock. <br> It echoed
                            hollowly through the dark cottage. Oksana woke with
                            a start, her heart pounding in fear. It came again. <br>
                            Knock, knock, knock. <br> Oksana thought of the
                            monsters. She hid under her blanket, praying the
                            thing would go away. <br> Knock, knock, knock. <br> Oksana
                            rose, grabbing a branch. She crept towards the door.
                            The wind howled eerily down the chimney. Oksana
                            swallowed and swung the door open. There was nothing
                            there. Her heart pounded fiercely as she stared out
                            at the snow whipping about in the light of her small
                            fire. Then she looked down. Oksana let out a shriek
                            of terror and leapt back, dropping her stick. It was
                            a demon. An evil spirit. <br> It had no body! <br> "Who are
                            you?" Oksana stuttered, clutching the door with
                            shaking hands. <br> "I am Cow's Head," it replied.
                            Indeed, Oksana saw at once that it was. The head was
                            brown, with curved horns and strange, haunted eyes. <br>
                            "I am cold and hungry. May I sleep by your fire?"
                            the Cow's Head asked. Its voice was cold and
                            lifeless. <br> Oksana gulped down her horror. <br> "Of
                            course," she said. <br> "Lift me over the threshold,"
                            demanded the Cow's Head hollowly. Oksana did as she
                            was bidden. <br> "Place me near the fire." <br> Anger warred
                            with compassion inside her, but compassion won.
                            Oksana put it next to the fire. <br> "I am hungry," said
                            the Cow's Head. <br> "Feed me." Oksana thought of her
                            meager food supply. The stew left in the pot was for
                            her breakfast. She fed it to Cow's Head. <br> "I will
                            sleep now," it said. There was no softening in its
                            attitude toward her. Nonetheless, Oksana made it
                            comfortable for the night, giving it her blanket and
                            sleeping in a cold corner with only her cloak to
                            keep her warm. <br> When she woke in the morning, Cow's
                            Head was gone. Where it had slept was a large trunk,
                            filled with the most beautiful gowns she had ever
                            seen. Under the gowns lay heaps of gold and jewels. <br>
                            Oksana stared blankly at the riches in front of her.
                            Her father's voice roused her. <br> "Daughter, I am
                            come." <br> Oksana forgot the trunk in her joy. She ran
                            into his arms. He had defied her stepmother to come
                            and bring her back to their home. <br> "Papa, come see!"
                            Oksana exclaimed as she pulled him into the cottage.
                            Her words tumbled over each other as she explained. <br>
                            Her father took her home. She was honored in her
                            town for her compassion and her bravery, and won
                            scores of suitors. She married soon after her return
                            from the cottage. <br> Hearing Oksana's story, and
                            seeing the riches she had received, Olena went to
                            the cottage in the forest and spent the night there.
                            But when Cow's Head appeared, she was too lazy to
                            serve it. In the morning, all her gowns had turned
                            to rags and her possessions to dust. <br> But Oksana
                            lived to a ripe old age in happiness and prosperity.
