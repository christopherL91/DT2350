                            Once there was an armadillo who lived in the
                            Bolivian rainforest.  He loved music more than
                            anything else in the world and all he wanted to do
                            was to be able to sing like many of the other
                            animals could.  He sat by the pond and listened to
                            the frogs calling to each other.  ‘I wish I could
                            sing as low as you can.  Can you teach me to sing
                            please?’ he asked them.  But the frogs just laughed
                            at him and said ‘Don’t be silly – armadillos can’t
                            sing!’ He sat under the trees and listened to the
                            crickets chirruping to each other.  ‘I wish I could
                            sing as high you do’ he said to them. Can you please
                            teach me?’ But the crickets laughed at him as well
                            and said ‘Don’t be silly – armadillos can’t sing!’
                            So the poor armadillo left the pond and walked
                            slowly back to the edge of the town.  Now the music
                            that the armadillo loved the best was the song of
                            the beautiful birds – hummingbirds, martins and
                            parrots.  He could hear them singing all day long
                            high up in the trees and yearned to be able to sing
                            as beautifully as they could.  Suddenly he heard the
                            beautiful song of some canaries in a cage being
                            taken to the local market by a young man.  The
                            armadillo stood spellbound as he listened to the
                            beautiful music.  He pleaded with the canaries to
                            teach him how to sing as beautifully as they could.
                            The canaries laughed just like the crickets and the
                            frogs and mocked the poor armadillo.  ‘Don’t be so
                            silly – everyone knows that armadillos can’t sing
                            and there is no point in you even trying to learn!’
                            they said to him scornfully.  So the poor armadillo
                            turned away, so sad that he was nearly in tears.
                            Now the man carrying the cage was a famous musician
                            and he realised that the armadillo would never be
                            happy until he was able to make the same beautiful
                            music that he heard all around him every day in the
                            rainforest.  So he said to the armadillo kindly ‘I
                            might be able to help you, but you will have to wait
                            a long time’ The armadillo was so excited that he
                            rushed over to the man and said ‘I really don’t care
                            how long I have to wait – all I want in life is to
                            be able to make beautiful music’ The musician said
                            to the armadillo ‘But in order to help you make the
                            beautiful music that you love so much, you will have
                            to wait until you die and you are such a beautiful
                            creature that I really wouldn’t want that to happen
                            to you too soon’ But the armadillo was so amazed
                            that the musician would be able to help him achieve
                            his ambition, that even the thought of death could
                            not stop him wanting the man to help him in any way
                            that he could.  They spent many hours talking and
                            the armadillo agreed that he would continue to enjoy
                            listening to the music of the other animals until he
                            became very old and then he would return to the
                            musician’s house so that he could learn how he might
                            be able to make beautiful music himself after his
                            death.  After living a long and happy life in the
                            forest, the armadillo realised that he was close to
                            death and returned to the town.  The musician made
                            him welcome and explained that after the armadillo
                            died, he would make a wonderful stringed instrument
                            from his shell and travel all through the land
                            playing music to all the people and animals.  This
                            made the armadillo very happy and he died with a
                            smile on his face at the thought of how he would at
                            long last achieve his greatest wish.  So the
                            musician did as he had promised and made a beautiful
                            harp from the shell of the armadillo and he
                            travelled all over the land playing sweet music in
                            memory of the armadillo.  Sometimes the musician
                            would play his instrument by the pond where the
                            frogs lived, and they would stare at him with big
                            eyes and say: "Listen! The armadillo has finally
                            learned to sing." Sometimes the musician would play
                            his instrument by the trees where the crickets
                            lived, and they would creep outside to stare at him
                            with big eyes and say: "Listen! The armadillo sings
                            so beautifully." And often the musician would visit
                            the town where the canaries now lived in cages in
                            the windows of all the houses and the little birds
                            twittered to each other in amazement: "Listen! The
                            armadillo makes the most beautiful music in the
                            whole forest now." And so it was. The armadillo had
                            learned to sing at last, and his voice was the
                            finest in the land.
