                            Brenda was busy baking a batch of blueberry muffins
                            in the kitchen of Butler's Bakery when the bell
                            rang.  "Be with you in a bit," Brenda called,
                            brushing her blond braid over her shoulder.  Brenda
                            put the blueberry muffins into the oven and bustled
                            into the store. A big brown bear stood with his paws
                            on the counter.  "Grumph," said the big brown bear.
                            "Aaaaa!" said Brenda Butler.  Brenda ran out through
                            the back door to get Bill Boyle, the policeman.
                            "Bill, there is a big brown bear in the bakery!"
                            Brenda cried.  "A bear?" Bill asked.  Bill followed
                            Brenda into the bakery. The bear was busy eating
                            blintz's and a bunch of bagels. It looked at Bill
                            Boyle and grunted bad-temperedly.  "Here bear. Nice
                            bear," Bill said nervously.  The bear gave Bill a
                            baleful grin. Bill backed away. The bear ambled
                            toward Bill. Bill ran.  "Oh boy," Brenda babbled and
                            fled from the store.  "I'd better call Barney," Bill
                            told Brenda.  Barney Blake was the local dogcatcher
                            for the town of Bradley. Barney drove up in his big
                            blue van and hopped out.  "Where's the bear?" Barney
                            asked Brenda.  "It's in the bakery," Brenda said.
                            Barney took a big net and went into the bakery.
                            Brenda heard a bang. Grabbing a broom from the
                            closet, Brenda rushed into the store. Barney was
                            standing on a bench, waving his arms and yelling
                            "Shoo!" at the bear. The bear was biting Barney's
                            black boots hungrily.  Brenda beat the bear with the
                            broom. "Back off, you big bully," Brenda shouted.
                            When the bear bit the broom, Barney jumped off the
                            bench and ran out of the bakery. Brenda followed.
                            "What happened to your net?" asked Brenda
                            breathlessly.  "The bear broke it," said Barney.  A
                            wave off smoke came billowing out the back door of
                            the bakery.  "My blueberry muffins are burning!"
                            cried Brenda. She raced into the kitchen.  As Brenda
                            removed the burnt blueberry muffins from the oven,
                            the bear came into the kitchen.  "Shoo you bumbling
                            brute," Brenda said to it. "You are bad for
                            business. You made me burn my muffins." Brenda threw
                            a blueberry muffin at the bear. The bear ate the
                            muffin and went back into the store.  "Is it gone?"
                            asked Bill, as he and Barney came cautiously into
                            the kitchen.  "The bear is in the store," said
                            Brenda. "I have a plan." Brenda sent Bill to get
                            some honeycomb and had Barney back his van behind
                            the bakery. Meanwhile, Brenda beat up a batch of
                            buttermilk biscuits. Then she mixed the honey from
                            the honeycomb into the batter. Soon, the kitchen was
                            bursting with the smell of honey buttermilk
                            biscuits.  The loud banging noises the bear was
                            making in the bakery store ceased abruptly as the
                            bear smelled the honey. Brenda carried the big batch
                            of biscuits out to the van. Bill opened the back
                            door. The breeze blew the smell of the
                            honey-buttermilk biscuits into the bakery. The bear
                            nudged open the swinging door of the bakery and
                            ambled into the kitchen. He knocked over the big
                            brown bowl and grumbled when he found no honey.
                            Then the bear sniffed his way out the back door.
                            Brenda had placed the basket of biscuits at the back
                            of Barney's van. The bear bounded up the ramp and
                            Barney banged the door shut. Brenda and Bill
                            cheered.  "I will take the bear back to the forest
                            and let him out," said Barney.  While Barney and the
                            bear drove away in the blue van, Brenda and Bill
                            bustled back into the bakery to clean up.
